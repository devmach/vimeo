Here’s a small code exercise.

The Exercise:

Attached is a csv file: clips.csv. Your job is to write code that will load in clips.csv and analyze the data against the rules listed below. Your code should output the results into two files; valid.csv will contain a list of clip_ids's that passed the tests and invalid.csv will contain a list of clip_id's that failed the tests. Requirements are to use PHP, utilize the SPL FilterIterator, and handle exceptions if a file cannot be read in or written to.

Rules: 
1. The clip must be public (privacy == anybody) 
2. The clip must have over 10 likes and over 200 plays 
3. The clip title must be under 30 characters

- Your implementation should demonstrate your object oriented skills and ability to define reusable components. 
- Memory usage is an important factor of a well implemented solution to this problem. The lists the program will process may be much larger than the sample provided with the test!
